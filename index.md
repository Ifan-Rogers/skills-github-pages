## Shwmae! 

### I'm a Foundation Climate Scientist at the Met Office, working within the monthly to decadal predictability and impacts team to better understand compound climate extremes impacting the energy sector.

I studied Physics at the University of Oxford between 2020 and 2024, where I studied the Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans and Theoretical Physics in my 4th year. I then moved to Exeter at the start of 2025 to start my role at the Met Office.
