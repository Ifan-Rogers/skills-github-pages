# Shwmae! Welcome to my website 

I studied Physics at the University of Oxford between 2020 and 2024, where I studied the Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans and Theoretical Physics in my 4th year. I then moved to Exeter at the start of 2025 to start a job at the Met Office as a Foundation Climate Scientist in the monthly to decadal predictability and impacts team.

I'm currently working on using model data to better understand the likelihood of compound climate extremes affecting the energy sector.
